C++ Design Book
---------------

I always wanted to write down some ideas about code design in C++. These few pages will maybe
be a bit messy at first, but over time they might converge towards something interesting.

You will need LaTeX to generate a readable book from the source in ./book
The source code for the examples can in ./src
Use the generators in ./devtools to generate the makefiles for your platform

Stay tuned :-)
